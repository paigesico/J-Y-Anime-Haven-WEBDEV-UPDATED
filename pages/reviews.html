          <h3>Attack on Titan</h3>
          <p><strong>Rating:</strong> ★★★★★ (5/5)</p>
          <p>
            I absolutely loved "Attack on Titan"! The story is intense and unpredictable, and the animation is phenomenal, especially the 3D maneuver gear scenes. 
            My favorite moment was Eren's transformation in the first season so epic and emotional. 
            The pacing is sometimes a bit slow in the middle of some seasons, but the world-building and character development more than make up for it. 
            Overall, a must-watch for action and emotional storytelling fans.

        <div class="review-content">
          <h3>Death Note</h3>
          <p><strong>Rating:</strong> ★★★★☆ (4/5)</p>
          <p>
            "Death Note" is a brilliant psychological thriller. The intellectual battle between Light and L kept me on the edge of my seat throughout. 
            My favorite scene was when L confronts Light in the darkened room—so tense and clever. 
            I did find the second half slightly weaker, with some drawn-out plot twists, but the writing, suspense, and moral dilemmas make it one of my favorite anime.

        <div class="review-content">
          <h3>Demon Slayer</h3>
          <p><strong>Rating:</strong> ★★★★★ (5/5)</p>
          <p>
            "Demon Slayer" is visually stunning every fight scene is like watching a work of art. 
            I loved the sibling bond between Tanjiro and Nezuko; it’s so heartwarming. 
            My favorite moment is the battle against Rui in the Natagumo Mountain arc emotionally charged and beautifully animated. 
            The only minor critique is that some filler episodes feel unnecessary, but overall, it’s a masterpiece with heart, action, and style.

          <h3>Naruto</h3>
          <p><strong>Rating:</strong> ★★★★☆ (4/5)</p>
          <p>
            "Naruto" is an iconic journey of growth, friendship, and perseverance. I loved watching Naruto evolve from an underdog into a hero, and the bonds with his friends are incredibly touching. 
            My favorite arc is the Chunin Exams! It’s full of strategy, excitement, and emotional moments. 
            I did find the numerous filler episodes frustrating at times, but the main story and character development are fantastic. A must-watch for classic shonen fans.
