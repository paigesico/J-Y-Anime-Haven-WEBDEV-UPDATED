    <h2>Our Story</h2>

    <section class="story">
      <h3>How it started?</h3>
      <p>Hi, my name is Sofia! I am the founder of this website and store. For many other fans like myself out there, I made the decision to open a store/website where they could purchase adorable merchandise and stay up to speed on the newest animes and reviews.</p>

    <section class="story">
      <h3>What do we sell?</h3>
      <p>We provide everything you need to show off your love for your favourite shows and characters, from t-shirts and hoodies to posters and phone cases. Together with other otakus, I produce our designs, putting our all into each one. As a result, you won't find these adorable and unique designs anywhere else!</p>

    <section class="story">
      <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
      <p>At Anime Haven, we believe that cuteness and joy can transform even the smallest moments. In a world that can sometimes feel overwhelming, we want to be a place where you can come to find comfort, joy, and of course, cute merchandise.</p>
